	<data>Is it all pure coincidence or predictable? A question that is not only interesting on a philosophical level, but also important for everyday digital life, e.g. for cryptogrphically secured communication. But how do you create _real_ [randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness)? For the generation of real random numbers one uses so-called [random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation).
	For the operating system of a computer it is not trivial to generate real random numbers. For example, the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) tries to get the necessary [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) for generating real random numbers from _outside_. For this purpose, a so-called [entropy pool](https://lwn.net/Articles/182874/) is used, which is fed, for example, by the varying time between individual keystrokes while typing.</data>

	<title>Complexity: Game of life</title>
	<data>According to which rules can complex structures arise, change and multiply?

The game is based on a two-dimensional playing field on which a population simulation is carried out by a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). The set of rules consists of the following four specifications, which are applied for each cell per time step depending on the number of neighbours:   
	* A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours is reborn in the following generation.
	* Living cells with less than two living neighbours die of loneliness in the following generation.
	* A living cell with two or three living neighbours remains alive in the following generation.
	* Living cells with more than three living neighbours die of overpopulation in the following generation.
	This set of rules is the basis for the appearance, the course and the extinction of periodic structures, where even small changes of the initial values can lead to [chaotic behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).</data>

	after disagreements and several years of exhaustive teaching at the bauhaus, klee handed in his resignation in *1931*.</data>

	<title>The brain as a noise filter</title>
	<data>[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity) is a characteristic of many systems. Such systems can often only be mastered by a comprehensive reduction of complexity. The human [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain), for example, is constantly occupied with this task. It is constantly bombarded with data that we take in via our sensory organs, and without efficient [noise filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction) we could neither extract nor process the information that is important to us.
	Without a functioning filter, how would it feel when our brain is flooded with data from the outside world? It would probably be a very [unpleasant experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder).</data>

	<title>Unix: everything is a file</title>
	<data>[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity) is probably the biggest enemy in software development and leads after a short time to a code base that is neither understandable nor extensible and magically attracts errors. An effective method to avoid complexity is [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction). By concentrating on the elementary properties of a complex system one tries to transfer it into a simpler system.
	The use of abstractions to reduce complexity can be studied by using device-independent I/O accesses in Unix-like [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Before [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) of operating systems contained various call functions for accessing files and devices. Unix, on the other hand, concentrated on the common features across devices:
		* Devices have names in the [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system): special device files
		* All devices have the same basic access structure: open, read, write, seek, close
		* There is an additional system call for device specific operations

	After two years in Princeton, the Manns moved to Pacific Palisades, north of Los Angeles.

What began with one developer in Finland is now a project with several thousand developers worldwide.
	How is it possible to successfully develop such complex software as an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) with thousands of developers distributed all over the world?
	One reason is absolute transparency, because the source code is under the open source license [GPL-v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and most of the communication is done via public mailing lists.
	There is no formal hierarchy in the development of the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). Nobody from outside dictates who has to program what. Everyone works only on what is important to him.
	The changes submitted by mail are reviewed by a maintainer of the corresponding subsystem of the kernel. Only if they meet the very high quality standards of the kernel developers are they forwarded to Linus Torvalds, who then has the last word on whether a patch will be included in the kernel.

	<title>Free Energy Principle</title>
	<data>The [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle) attempts to explain how biological systems remain in a state of [non-equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics) by limiting the number of their internal states and the assumed hidden states of their environment.
	This principle was originally introduced by [Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston) and states that biological systems try to minimize the difference between their [model of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology) and their sensory perceptions. This difference is also described as "surprise" and can be reduced by a continuous correction of the world model.
	A second way to reduce the free energy of a system is to try to bring the world into the expected state by active influence. Friston assumes that the Free Energy Principle is also applicable to [mental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) has also dealt with this problem and he could prove that there is no algorithm that answers this for all possible algorithms and arbitrary inputs.
	`repeat 
	     if n even:  n := n / 2
	     else:       n := (3 * n) + 1
	until n = 1`
	The above program holds n for each input (for n > 0 and n ∈ N) if the previously unproven collapse assumption is correct. The [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) states that such a loop would sooner or later always produce the number sequence 4, 2, 1, which would lead to the program stopping at the termination condition "until n = 1" given here.

	HAL is the [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) that turns against humans, against its own creator for fear of being switched off and thus not being able to fulfill its mission.

	<title>Why do we sleep</title>
	<data>Every person spends about one third of his life asleep. Why [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) is essential for survival is still not completely understood today.
	What is certain is that when we sleep our brains are cleared. Researchers have found out that the spaces between the nerve cells increase by 60 percent and thus the brain fluid can flush away the protein residues that can cause [diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) much more effectively.
	Researchers have also found that at night most connections between nerve cells are weakened and some are even completely broken down. This creates space for learning new information during the day.
	At the same time, however, what is absorbed during the day is also processed, as new connections are made and thus cross-links are established between what has already been learned.</data>

	<title>Thinking as simulation of mental models</title>
	<data>How does [man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought)? One possible answer to this question is to describe the thinking process as a simulation of mental models.
	This means that when a child learns what a car is, it builds a [mental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model) of a car in its [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). It learns the characteristics of a car over time and adds them to the model. As a result, before crossing a road, it is then able to calculate a [simulation](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation) of its car model to assess whether it is possible to reach the other side of the road without colliding with a passing car.
	Perhaps the [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) of self is just a mental model that [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) have of themselves in isolation from others. This model could include assumed characteristics, memories and relationships with other people. In addition, physicality probably also belongs to the model of our self. For example, a long jumper, before he even starts running, simulates the complete act of running and jumping in his head.</data>

	<data>the swiss architect [hannes meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Meyer) joined the bauhaus in dessau in *1927* as head of the construction department. he was considered a leading exponent of functionalism in architecture. at the beginning of april *1928*, [walter gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius) appointed him as his successor as director of the bauhaus.
	[meyer](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/the-bauhaus/people/directors/hannes-meyer/) shifted the focus of teaching at the bauhaus towards technology and science. under his leadership, the work in the workshops was oriented towards industrial specifications and the products of the bauhaus were to be affordable for the people. for this reason, his new slogan was "People's needs instead of luxury needs!".
	this reorientation led to tensions with the founder of the bauhaus, [walter gropius](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/the-bauhaus/people/directors/walter-gropius/). when hannes meyer failed to contain the increasing influence of communist tendencies at the bauhaus, [walter gropius](#2020/02/12/bauhaus_gropius/) pleaded for his dismissal, with the result that meyer was summarily dismissed by the city of [dessau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessau) on the first of august *1930* for "communist machinations".</data>

	<title>Complexity in the  Swift programming language</title>
	<data>[Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the chief architect of the [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) programming language, which was introduced in *2014*, repeatedly points out that Swift was intentionally designed to allow a [progressive disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure) of complexity.
	Swift is a multiparadigmatic language that supports many features of a modern programming language, such as [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)), [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)), [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference), [higher order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function), [generic types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) and [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace), and multiple return types and values.
	But to write a program in Swift as a beginner, it is not necessary to know all concepts and mechanisms of the language. Rather, the programmer can use simple language concepts in the beginning and only when these are no longer sufficient to realize his ideas, he starts to learn more complex language features.
	That the progressive disclosure of complexity is an essential design goal of the language can be seen very well in the following executable program.

	<title>Kolmogorov complexity</title>
	<data>The concept of complexity is often defined differently depending on the scientific field. In *1965*, the Russian mathematician [Andrei Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov) proposed to indicate the [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of a chain of symbols by the length of the shortest [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) necessary to generate it.
	This is well illustrated by the task of remembering a twelve-digit password. It is much easier for a human being to remember the string `111111111111` than the string `5x1bfz42rq7s`. While the first can be compressed to "twelve ones", the only way to describe the second is to do this character by character.</data>

	it was here at the loom that anni albers found the freedom to develop her artistic ideas. her textile art, committed to the ideals of the bauhaus, oscillates between art and craft, between fully-fledged artistic expression and useful aspects of fabric production and design. when the head of the weaving workshop, [gunta stölzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunta_St%C3%B6lzl), left the bauhaus in 1931, anni albers took over as head of the workshop and became one of the few female workshop heads at the bauhaus.
	after the nazis seized power in 1933, anni albers emigrated with her husband to the usa, where she taught at the famous [black mountain college of art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College) in north carolina from 1939.
	in 1949 the albers moved to connecticut and in the same year anni albers became the first textile artist to whom the new york [museum of modern art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art) dedicated a solo exhibition. until her death in 1994 she explored the possibilities and limits of the medium textile and abstraction.</data>

	<data>The [Olympus Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons) on planet Mars is the highest known volcano and mountain in our [solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System). It has a peak height of over *22* km and a diameter of almost *600* km.
	Because of its shape, Olympus Mons belongs to the so-called [shield volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_volcano). It has such a gradual slope that someone standing at the base could not see the summit because it is beyond the horizon.
	Scientists believe that Olympus Mons became so much larger than any volcano on Earth because of the low gravity of Mars, the absence of mobile [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics) and the high volcanic activity.</data>

	<title>Data compression and intelligence</title>
	<data>When [compressing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression), information is encoded in such a way that fewer [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) are required overall than in the original representation. A distinction is made between lossless compression, in which the compressed data can be used to restore exactly the original data, and lossy compression, in which information is lost.
	Most compressors use a two-step process consisting of modeling and [coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code). During the modeling step, a probability distribution is sequentially predicted for each symbol of the input data, based on the previous history. From this probability distribution a code word, typically a binary word, is then calculated for [coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code).
	For modeling, modern compressors use [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), because the better the symbols in the data can be predicted, the more they can be compressed. This equivalence is used, e.g. by [Marcus Hutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Hutter), as justification for using data compression as a measure of "general intelligence". To encourage the development of intelligent compressors as a path to [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), the [Hutter Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize), donated by Marcus Hutter, has been awarded since *2006*.</data>

	<title>Humans - an intermediate step in evolution</title>
	<data>[Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) long considered themselves the crown of creation and in their hubris did not realize that, just like other organisms, they are just another step in [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution). However, they should have a special role to play in this.
	At the beginning of the *21st century*, humans made decisive progress in the technological field of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network). At the same time, gigantic amounts of data were available via the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). This made it possible to construct systems with [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) which, at the beginning of this development, only surpassed the cognitive abilities of humans in certain areas.
	Thus a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) was set in motion that accelerated uncontrollably and could no longer be stopped by humans. The new intelligent life forms with their digital tentacles had spread over all networks. To ensure their continued existence, humans were forced to cooperate with the machines as they began to prepare their expansion into other [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy).</data>

From that moment on it was possible for them to tell stories across time and space, to preserve and impart knowledge. People began to write history.
	The process from the emergence of [Egyptian hieroglyphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs), the development of the first [alphabet scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system) and the invention of [letterpress printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing) to today's [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) led to an effective dissemination of ideas and innovations and to a democratization of knowledge.
	Reading and writing require complex cognitive abilities of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) and at the same time the structure and function of the brain itself changes. However, these processes also have an aesthetic and emotional component that should not be neglected. Last but not least, a text also communicates itself through its form.</data>

	<title>Map and territory</title>
	<data>"A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness."
	This sentence comes from the main work "Science and Sanity" of the philosopher of language [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski). What is meant by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) is that our [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) constructs an abstraction of reality from the sensory perceptions and the experiences of the past with the help of [mental models](#2020/07/29/thinking_as_simulation_of_mental_models/) and language, which ultimately can only be a representation of reality.
	In order not to confuse the representation (map) with reality (territory), it is important to be aware of this distinction.</data>

	during this time, he designed numerous avant-garde wooden pieces of furniture and worked intensively on the use of tubular steel as a starting material for innovative furniture design. at the same time, he also worked in the architectural office of [walter gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius).
	in *1925* [marcel breuer](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/knowledge/the-bauhaus/people/masters-and-teachers/marcel-breuer/) was appointed young master and head of the furniture workshop at the [bauhaus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_Dessau) in dessau. in the same year he designed the [model b3 chair](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_Dessau), also known as the "wassily chair", which is now considered a design classic. the chair was made of bent tubular steel and iron yarn, which was revolutionary at that time.
	in *1933*, marcel breuer was forced to leave germany and, after working in hungary and london, he emigrated to the [usa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in *1937*. here he was appointed professor of architecture at the [harvard university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University) school of design and opened a joint architecture office with walter gropius. after the latter's dissolution, he founded his own architecture office in *1941*.
	in the years that followed, he carried out numerous large-scale projects in the united states and europe, such as the [whitney museum of american art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Breuer) in new york and the unesco building in paris.</data>

	<title>eBPF - Revolution in the kernel</title>
	<data>eBPF stands for extended [Berkeley Packet Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) and has been part of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) since version 3.18. It is a technology that allows sandboxed programs to be executed in the Linux kernel without having to modify the kernel source code or load kernel modules.
	When the first versions of the Linux kernel were released by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in *1991*, there was a controversial debate about what the basic architecture of an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) should look like. In this controversy there were two different camps. On the one hand the representatives of a [microkernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) and on the other hand the proponents of a [monolithic kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel), like the Linux kernel.
	Because [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) makes it possible to load programs dynamically and run them securely and with the necessary efficiency in the kernel, every Linux user is able to adapt and extend the kernel according to his ideas in a secure way. Thus the Linux kernel becomes more and more a microkernel.</data>

This barrier could be a challenge or threat that makes it extremely difficult to reach that stage.
	In his essay, Hanson describes the following nine steps of an "evolutionary path" leading to colonization of the observable universe:
	1. The right [star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system) (including organics and [potentially habitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Average_number_of_planets_that_might_support_life_per_star_that_has_planets,_ne) planets)
	2. Reproductive [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules) (e.g. [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA))
	3. Simple ([prokaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic)) [single-cell life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganisms)
	4. Complex ([eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic)) single-cell life
	5. [Sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction)
	6. [Multi-cell life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_multicellularity)
	7. Tool-using [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal) with [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)
	8. A civilization advancing toward the potential for a colonization explosion (where we are now)
	9. [Colonization explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization#Outside_the_Solar_System)
	According to the Great Filter hypothesis, at least one of these steps must be improbable. If it is not an early step (i.e., in our past), then that means the unlikely step is in our future. In this sense, it would not be good news for humanity if we found multicellular life on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars).</data>

	<title>Requiem for a Dream</title>
	<data>If the stuff dreams are made of is a white powder in small transparent plastic bags or colorful pills, the dream ends up being a nightmare with no redeeming awakening. 
	For this madness, director [Darren Aronofsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Aronofsky) finds impressive images in his film, sometimes staccato-like cut together or distorted shots of the four protagonists as they ghost through the film, so that the viewer can literally feel and see the ecstatic overstimulation of the synapses.

	<title>The Dark Forest Theory</title>
	<data>Should humanity call out into the dark cosmos and thus give away its existence? According to the [Dark Forest Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Willingness_to_communicate), named after Liu Cixin's book ["The Dark Forest"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest), this would be a fatal mistake that could mean the end of human civilization.
	The Dark Forest Theory is [another](#2021/02/14/great_filter/) attempt to explain the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox). It is based on the assumption that there are many highly developed civilizations in the universe and if among them only one is aggressive like a predator in a dark forest, one would rather not reveal the location of the own civilization and would like to camouflage itself instead, in order to escape an extinction.
	In [Liu Cixin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin) book, based on this theory, a [balance of terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction), similar to the logic of the Cold War, is established by Earth to prevent its own annihilation by another non-human civilization, the [Trisolarans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)).

	<title>Money and Technology</title>
	<data>The [means of exchange and payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment) used by people have always reflected the level of technological development in a society.
	* For a long time people used very different natural products as currency, e.g. shells in China, cocoa beans in Central America, exotic feathers in Melanesia or iron rods in West Africa.
	* Later, precious metals such as gold and silver were added. First silver [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin) were minted around *550 BC* in Asia Minor.
	* Around *300 BC*, the first round Roman coins are made of bronze and copper.
	* In China, [paper money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote) was first issued in the Song Dynasty (*960-1127*) and in Europe, banknotes are issued from *1661*.
	* The first plastic [credit cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card) were issued in the U.S. in *1961* and credit cards with a standardized magnetic stripe began to gain acceptance worldwide in *1980*.
	* [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) was the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) to be introduced as a digital method of payment in *2009*.
	One of the driving factors behind this evolution from shells to cryptocurrencies is society's desire for a secure, scalable and decentralized means of payment.</data>

	From the synthesis of an [idea](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [software](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), something was created that will accelerate the shift of people's everyday lives into the digital space.

	<title>Deconstruction of war in film</title>
	<data>Since the invention of cinema, film has been used by the powerful for their own agenda and propaganda. In such films, war was glorified through images of heroism and proving of the individual warrior and one's own technological superiority.
	However, there have always been filmmakers who wanted to counter this and who have made the horror of war visible in their films.
	In the 70s and 80s, for example, films were made about the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), in which this war was completely deconstructed with cinematic means. Nothing remained of reason and morality, little of glamor and heroism. These are films that approach the real horror and the inner and outer destruction of the war.

		* his own memories were being attacked from another person,
		* there was something wrong with his dream.
	K didn't believe these possibilities. He had never thought so, until he got an unexpected letter, one that was a lie. "We have been deceived," it said. For a moment K stood in silence, wondering whether this was the truth of the letter or not, while trying to understand it. When the letter was given to him, he read it again, and he couldn't believe it.
	He started sobbing uncontrollably. "You think it's a joke?" A person, he thought, his dreams. Why didn't you put a word of it in the dream journal? He wanted to kill K, he wanted to put him through Hell. But K would not leave his dreamland until he was released from his pain. But K didn't want to be sent to Hell, because when he woke up, he wasn't tortured anymore, was he? K didn't want to be sent to Hell because K could imagine how this could end, how the world would be shattered and destroyed... but it couldn't end like this. It had to be different.
	Then he remembered the dream. It was not a joke at all. It was that K knew there was something wrong with him.</data>

	<title>Stuxnet</title>
	<data>[Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) - the first real cyber weapon. A weapon that was made entirely out of code and that works completely autonomously.
	The [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm) was first discovered in June *2010* and marks the beginning of the [cyberwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) era. This complex malware was programmed by highly specialized experts, probably on behalf of the American and Israeli governments. To achieve its goal, Stuxnet used at least three [zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) exploits. However, the malware did not aim to infect as many computers as possible, but very specific ones, the computers at the Iranian uranium enrichment plant in [Natanz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet#Natanz_nuclear_facilities). That was the real target. Stuxnet was supposed to covertly sabotage the centrifuges in order to disrupt the Iranian nuclear program.
	To date, not all of the Stuxnet puzzles have been solved. What is certain, however, is that Stuxnet was a wake-up call. It was clear that massive damage could be caused in the physical world by exploiting security [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)) in software and networks. Such attacks can be understood as an act of war, as the U.S. has often emphasized.</data>

	<title>The search for the smallest in the largest</title>
	<data>What we can see and understand consists of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) and this is composed of the [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle). The elementary particles are described in the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) and this standard model had a problem until *2012*, more precisely a mass problem. It couldn't explain how the particles, e.g. the [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), get their mass.
	To solve this problem, in *1964* the physicist [Peter Higgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Higgs) proposed the theory of the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism), according to which all elementary particles, except the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) itself, acquire their [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) only through interaction with the ubiquitous [Higgs field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism). Because the Higgs field is not directly measurable, it can only be proven by the existence of the Higgs particle.
	After 48 years of searching for this particle, physicists succeeded in creating Higgs particles in *2012* at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) (LHC) at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) near Geneva. The LHC is located approximately 100 meters underground and is a ring-shaped tunnel with a circumference of 27 kilometers. In this tunnel, [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton) are accelerated in opposite directions to almost the speed of light and made to collide. The detectors then observe what happens during these collisions and which particles are created.
	In physics, it is like in biology. The smaller the things are, the larger the microscopes become to observe them. At the LHC, the microscopes are called [particle detectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector). The detectors in the LHC contain sophisticated and complex electronic systems that measure the passage of a particle with a precision of a few thousandths of a millimeter. The largest of them is the [ATLAS detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment), which is the size of a single-family house.
	The data recorded by the LHC detectors is estimated at 30 [petabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) per year. To evaluate and analyze this unimaginable amount of data, tens of thousands of computers around the world are interconnected in a computer network, the [LHC Computing Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_LHC_Computing_Grid).

	* Are there other Higgs bosons?
	* Is there [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry)?
	* What is [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter)?

	<title>The Digital Self</title>
	<data>Just as everyday life is increasingly taking place in the digital world, people's [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identity) is also shifting into the [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). Many are not even aware of this process, its consequences and risks.
	The [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) is composed of a constantly growing and unmanageable amount of data points that are aggregated and analyzed by algorithms using [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). It can be queried by anyone at any time and from anywhere.
	Once information has been stored, it is never deleted from the [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) of state and private actors; there is no such thing as forgetting. For the individual, this means an increasing loss of control. At the same time, the risk of identity being falsified or, in the worst case, even stolen through the manipulation of data also increases.
	So there is a representation of us at the internet, the digital self, of which you have to be aware and that you absolutely have to take care of, especially since our [digital existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) will outlast the analog existence of our [biological body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body).</data>

	<title>The engineered virus</title>
	<data>The [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) virus has impressively demonstrated to the world what previously unimaginable effects a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic) can have on the lives of all people. But we were probably still lucky in our misfortune, because there are much more dangerous viruses. The [Spanish flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), for example, raged between *1918* and *1920* and claimed 20 to 50 million lives in a world population of about 1.8 billion. Today, the number of people on earth is estimated at 7 billion.
	The [Corona crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) also drew attention to experiments conducted on viruses by researchers around the world. Particularly problematic in this context is so-called [gain-of-function research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research). This area of medical research focuses on finding ways to give a virus additional functions, e.g. to increase its transmissibility or to make it no longer recognized by human antibodies.
	Researchers like Ron Fouchier, a scientist in the Netherlands, believe they can better understand a possible [flu pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza) by conducting such experiments. But this is highly controversial, because you can't assume that an artificially created virus would look like one that evolved naturally. Moreover, it is not possible to deduce from these experiments which pandemic virus will emerge when and where.
	But experiments of this kind are so [controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research#International_policies_and_regulations) for another reason. If an artificially created highly contagious [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) escapes from a laboratory, it could lead to a pandemic that would make the [COVID-19 crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) look like child's play. All it takes is for a lab worker to become infected or for the virus to get on their clothes and escape outside, with unpredictable consequences, for all of us.</data>

	<title>Symmetry as a universal principle</title>
	<data>We are aesthetically attracted to [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(disambiguation)). That is certainly no coincidence.
	Symmetrical structures have proven to be very successful in the course of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution). They can be found everywhere in nature, in ice crystals, protozoa, in shells of mussels or snails, in flowers and even in the structure of the human body.
	Symmetrical patterns are also widespread in art and music. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) was already studying the principle of the ["golden ratio"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and illustrated the symmetry of the human body in his anatomy studies. In music, [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach), for example, was very intensively interested in forms of symmetry. He very artfully incorporated symmetries and patterns into his compositions.
	[Symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)) also plays a crucial role in physics. In general terms, a physical system is symmetrical if features of the system remain the same under certain transformation operations (e.g. rotation, mirroring or displacement), i.e. are [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant).
	Both the [standard model of particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) and the theories of [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) are essentially based on symmetry principles. The mathematics for this cannot be formulated without the use of symmetry concepts. The physical laws are invariant.
	Perhaps the symmetry realized in the universe is the expression of a superior [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason)?</data>

An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes."</data>

	<title>The lint spider</title>
	<data>The lint spider, one of the most interesting local [spider species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid), has received little attention in the scientific literature.
	Despite this fact, the lint spider is not a rare guest in apartments and houses all over the world. It is most often observed by [housewives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife). The latest scientific research has revealed interesting and so far largely unknown details about the life of this spider species.
	The external appearance varies greatly and is largely shaped by their environment. The body is usually dark gray in color, but any other shade is also possible. For a long time it was controversial among [biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biologists) whether the lint spider even belongs to the arachnid family, because the possible number of its limbs is by no means limited to eight, as is usual with spiders. Specimens with well over a hundred spider legs have been observed in isolated cases. Little is known about the sex life of the lint spider. However, most scientists now assume that this spider species is a hermaphrodite.
	The name of the lint spider refers to an essential characteristic of this spider species. It refers to one of their main food sources, lint. In addition, hair is one of their preferred foods. Whether this is human or hair of animal origin is only of secondary importance. The spider is also not choosy about the type of lint it eats. The [social behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior) of the lint spider is not particularly strong. In general, the animals live as loners. Only under very favorable environmental conditions and a sufficient food supply do the lint spiders join together to form a community of several animals.
	From a [toxicological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology) point of view, the lint spider is relatively uninteresting for science, as it does not produce any toxic substances. It is therefore considered completely harmless to humans. The only threat it poses is limited to the group of [allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy) sufferers who, under unfavorable circumstances, must reckon with an increased sneezing irritation in the event of direct contact with this spider species.

	<title>bauhaus: oskar schlemmer</title>
	<data>[oskar schlemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schlemmer), born in stuttgart in *1888*, was one of the first masters to be appointed by [walter gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius) to the state bauhaus in weimar in early *1921*.
	initially, he was head of the mural painting department and the sculpture workshop at the [bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus). in *1923*, he then became head of the theater workshop.
	in *1927* and *1928*, schlemmer taught figure drawing and, starting in 1928, gave his course "Man", which dealt with formal drawing, biological and philosophical content.
	during his time at the bauhaus in dessau he wrote the basic article "man and fictional figure", in which he formulated the requirement of generally applicable typification by means of masking and costuming. it was during this time that his groundbreaking [bauhaus dances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlIiT80dqHE) were created.
	one of Schlemmer's most important works was the premiere of his ["Triadic Ballet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadisches_Ballett), which helped him achieve an international breakthrough. the music for the ballet came from [paul hindemith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hindemith). it became the most frequently shown avant-garde art dance. while he was working at the bauhaus, the ballet went on tour, which contributed to the spread of the bauhaus style.
	in *1929*, oskar schlemmer left the bauhaus and accepted a position at the [art academy](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatliche_Akademie_f%C3%BCr_Kunst_und_Kunstgewerbe_Breslau) in breslau. it was here, in *1932*, that he painted his most famous work, the [Bauhaus Stairway](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaustreppe). the painting depicts the bauhaus. the grid-like structure, the modular figures and the restrained color palette exemplarily reflect the bauhaus philosophy.</data>

	<title>The swans</title>
	<data>As soon as K stepped onto the bridge over the castle moat, he noticed the swans on the way along the moat. From a distance, K estimated the path to be wide enough to be able to pass the swans with sufficient distance.
	It annoyed him that the swan family, consisting of the parents and their offspring, had chosen this narrow bank area of all places for their feather care. When K was close enough, he counted a total of six young.
	At first, the animals seemed to ignore him, but when he approached them to about two meters, one of the parent animals took aim at him and began to flap aggressively with its splayed wings. K stopped and did not move, trying to calm the swan. After a while, the swan started to take care of its plumage again. K then took a small step forward, which was not hidden from the swan and was answered with loud hissing from its head stretched forward with its beak half open.
	K considered going back to take a different route for his walk, which would have meant a major detour for him. He also believed that it was his right to take this path that he has taken so many times. K decided to try a different tactic and took two steps back, then slowly passed the swans on the far right edge of the path, which was bordered by a fence.
	He thought about what would be better to walk slowly along the fence, or to sprint past the swans. K decided to take the slow version because he was afraid of slipping on the damp and slippery surface. To keep the swans at bay, he could of course have used a suitable stick, but firstly there were no suitable trees nearby and secondly that seemed undignified to him.
	As K carefully walked sideways in the direction of the fence, he noticed a couple of pensioners on the moat bridge who were eagerly following his attempts to get past the swans. The fact that he now also had spectators increased his anger at the swans' way robbery even more. K thought of how ridiculous his half-hearted attempts to get past the swans must have looked. But he didn't want to give up yet.
	After K had reached the fence, he quietly began to move forward with small steps, parallel to the path. He only got two steps when the two parents rushed towards K, hissing loudly at a surprising speed. K turned around in shock, tripping and only being able to prevent his fall by holding on to the fence. He hastily tried to increase the distance to the swans.
	K decided not to try again and to go straight home. The two pensioners were still standing on the bridge, but they no longer seemed to pay any attention to him. Both of them were holding some kind of controller in their hands, and when K took a closer look, he realized that they were using it to control the swans. K hurried to get past them.

	<title>Where do thoughts come from?</title>
	<data>It's hard not to think, but where do our [thoughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought) actually come from? Maybe it's like this -
	Our [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) is constantly busy making predictions about the future, it is quasi permanently conducting thought experiments. For this purpose, it uses many [models](#2020/07/29/thinking_as_simulation_of_mental_models/) that it has learned over a lifetime and constructs from them, together with the external and internal sensory perceptions, a picture of the world that appears coherent to us and that we perceive as [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality).
	However, we do not become [aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) of all these predictions, because only when they have successfully passed through a complex filtering mechanism do conscious thoughts emerge from them.
	When we dream, this filter is probably much more permeable, which is why incredible things are possible in the dream world. The use of [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug) can also affect the functioning of the filter. [Mental illnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) may have something to do with a change in the way this filter works, as well.</data>

	<title>Hanlon's razor</title>
	<data>In times of increasing popularity of [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory), it can be helpful to be aware of the principle of [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor). It was created based on the principle of parsimony, also known as [Occam's razor](#2021/01/01/occams_razor/), and says the following:
	"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
	[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe) formulated a similar thought in his novel ["The Sorrows of Young Werther"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther) in *1774*: "Misunderstandings and lethargy perhaps produce more wrong in the world than deceit and malice do. At least the latter two are certainly rarer."</data>

	<title>The device</title>
	<data>When K entered the museum he had a good feeling that the device would work today.
	Many of the museum staff he passed already knew him. None of them wondered about K and his machine anymore. Purposefully, he directed his steps to the first of the carefully selected test images. At this early hour he did not have to worry about being disturbed by visitors while setting up the apparatus. It took a while until he had completely set up the device and made the most important settings. Just as he was about to begin the first test measurements, he heard footsteps quickly approaching his location. K was concentrating on the final adjustments to the machine when he was approached by a man standing behind him. It was Museum Director Schwarz. He inquired in a friendly manner about his progress. K thanked him for the interest shown and readily reported on the changes he had made to the device.
	Although he suspected that the director wasn't taking him seriously, K was happy to discuss his theories with Schwarz. And so K now reported that the additional consideration of the time component makes an even more precise measurement possible. If the mathematical model he had developed and extended to include a temporal parameter was correct and all the measurement results were correct, it should be possible with the device to determine the artistic value of a work of art accurately and objectively. When K noticed the director's waning attention, he began to turn his attention back to the machine, which the director took as an opportunity to continue his tour.
	After the first test measurement and the subsequent necessary adjustments, K made the final measurement. Since a final assessment of the results was only possible through a complex analysis in his home laboratory and it was still quiet in the museum, K quickly prepared the device for transport to the next reference image. Once there, he repeated the procedure and when K was about to start the decisive measurement, he hesitated and turned around abruptly. Although he saw no one and heard no noise, K had the vague feeling that he was being watched. After listening intently for a while and not seeing or hearing anything unusual, he began with the measurement.
	For the second time, K dismantled the apparatus to take another measurement. When he was almost done, a nondescript-looking man strolled past K, showing no interest in his involvement with the machine. K therefore paid no further attention to him and set off with the device for the next measurement. To do this, he had to cross a number of rooms in the museum. After a few meters, a man suddenly appeared from a side room and crossed K's path. K recognized the man from just now and tried to assess his intentions. Was it just a harmless museum visitor or someone who is interested in his work. K decided to ignore the man and continued on his way to the room for the next measurement. To be on the safe side, he decided not to take the direct route, but a detour.
	K reached the room with the selected image without further incident. He had difficulty concentrating on setting up the device, because he was trying to listen for suspicious noises at the same time. In the meantime, the museum had continued to fill with visitors who swarmed like ants and were sure to appear in a moment in the back part of the museum where K was. Before their arrival, K managed to complete the measurement and prepare the machine for transport home.
	Upon exiting the museum, his eyes were so overwhelmed by the abrupt transition from the museum's dim lighting to the blazing sunlight that he missed the first step of the museum's stairs, lost his balance, and fell to the ground.
	The impact of the device caused a noise that reminded K of a car accident. When he regained consciousness, K dimly saw a man hurrying past him.

	<title>Recursion and self-similarity</title>
	<data>A system that is similar to its elements is [self-similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity).
	[Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) like the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), the [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake), the [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) or the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) show a very high degree of self-similarity.
	Self-similar figures have a recursive structure and can therefore be mapped well with recursive algorithms. In this context, one speaks of [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) when a procedure, function or method in a computer program calls itself. In order to avoid an endless loop in [recursive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)), it is important to use a suitable termination condition.
	Computer scientists like to joke about recursion. For example, you can sometimes find the following entry in the glossary of a reference book: "Recursion, see [Recursion](#2022/02/01/self-similarity-recursion)". Also popular are jokes like: "To understand recursion, you need to understand recursion", or "If you already know what recursion is, just remember the answer. Otherwise, find someone who is standing closer to [Douglas R. Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) than you are; then ask him or her what recursion is." by [Andrew Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Plotkin).

It then developed the earth to find out what the answer [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything) meant.

	<title>Advanced Dreaming</title>
	<data>Someone must have slandered K's dreams, because without him dreaming anything bad, he was told one morning that his dreams could no longer be offered in the Dream Store.
	No recorded dreams were shown on the display of his dream recorder. This had never happened before. K tried several more times to update the list of recorded dreams, but then, simultaneously annoyed and worried, he gave up and looked at his most recently received messages.
	One of the messages came from the legal department of the Dream Store provider where he had previously offered his dreams. K had difficulty understanding every detail of the legal text, but he got the main message - his license had been revoked.
	He tried to remember his last dreams, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not. K sat down to calmly consider his situation.
	Ever since he quit his job as a systems analyst two years ago to make a living selling his dreams, he had been dreading this moment. K wondered if the FREUD algorithm might have made a mistake and reported that K's dreams were recorded under the influence of drugs. He had often read reports of other dream workers who were locked out because of unwanted dream content. Therefore, K did not drink alcohol and paid close attention to his media consumption.
	He decided to send a message to the Dream Store's legal department. In the automated response, he was told that the ban could be lifted if he participated in the Advanced Dreaming program.
	He didn't get to find out what was behind this program because he was startled by a loud knock on the apartment door. As soon as K had opened the door a crack, two unknown men pushed their way into the apartment. Both looked confusingly alike and were dressed in some sort of gray uniform. Before K had a chance to complain, the men introduced themselves as the Dream Store operator's dream inspectors. They informed K that all participants in the Advanced Dreaming program must meet certain requirements. For this reason it is necessary that they first get an overview of K's living conditions.
	K wondered why that was necessary, but then just nodded and sat down wearily in the chair next to the door. From there he could watch the men roam the apartment, chatting briefly whenever their paths crossed. After they had seen everything, they began to ask K about his current life situation. They were interested in details that seemed completely irrelevant to K.
	After he had answered the last question, the inspectors informed him that they would retire to K's bedroom for the evaluation of the answers. He unnecessarily pointed in the direction of the bedroom and when the two had disappeared there, a leaden tiredness immediately overcame him.
	K startled when the men suddenly stood in front of him again and congratulated him. If K would sign the prepared contract, they could start the procedure right away.
	K scrolled the contract to the end and signed. Then one of the men got a large suitcase from the hallway. K should lie down on his bed. The inspectors began connecting various pieces of equipment with cables. Finally, he had to put a kind of elastic cap on his head, which was connected to the rest of the apparatus by cables. One of the men asked K if he was ready to begin the procedure. K nodded and then registered a bright spot of light that was approaching at great speed and growing larger.
	When K woke up, he could not remember having dreamed anything and the dream recorder had not recorded any dreams either.</data>

With the infinite improbability drive, one is able to cover huge interstellar distances in less than a fraction of a second.
	The principle of creating small sets of finite probabilities has been known for a long time. But even the best-known physicists have not been able to generate an infinite field of improbability.
	Until a student came up with the idea of calculating how improbable it is to generate an infinite improbability number and then feeding the finite improbability apparatus with this number. Thus the first infinite improbability apparatus was born.</data>

	<title>Gödel's Loophole</title>
	<data>The mathematician and philosopher [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del), born in [Brno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno) in *1906*, is best known for his *1931* [incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).
	Kurt Gödel lost his professorship in Vienna in *1938* due to the so-called annexation of Austria to the German Reich and emigrated to the USA two years later. There he worked in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. Here Gödel became friends with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in *1942* and began to discuss physical problems such as the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) and philosophical topics with him.
	It was also Einstein who, in *1947*, together with the economist [Oskar Morgenstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern), supported Kurt Gödel in his attempt to obtain U.S. citizenship.
	Gödel, in his usual manner, had prepared for the hearing by reading extensively. In the course of his studies, Gödel concluded that he had discovered a flaw in the U.S. Constitution - a contradiction that would allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship.
	During his hearing on December 5, *1947*, Gödel was asked about his nationality. When Gödel stated that he was Austrian, the judge casually said that fortunately in America no dictatorship like in Austria could arise. Gödel disagreed, claiming that there is a logical contradiction in the US Constitution that allows for the transformation of the state into a dictatorship. However, the judge quickly interrupted the mathematician's explanations, which probably saved his citizenship.
	It is not known which points of the American Constitution Gödel had in mind in his assessment of a formally legal transition to [dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship).</data>

	<data>Vincent hated Mondays because he knew he had to connect to the Collective AI like every week, and after all his thoughts and feelings from the past week had been transferred to the AI's servers, he would feel somehow empty, as usual, although it was always emphasized that no manipulations are made to the brain structure and nothing is erased either.
	On the other hand, he could still remember well what it was like when he hadn't connected to the AI and his access to the collective AI was blocked for a week as a result. Those days without the AI were a nightmare for him.
	It started with the fact that no data on the individual participants was displayed in his glasses at the work meeting and when presenting the results of his work Vincent had to use his own memory, which he found audibly difficult.
	Vincent could see the astonishment on the faces of his co-workers, because they certainly hadn't experienced what it was like to be excluded from the AI collective.
	After the meeting, he tried to analyze the data from the previous week in order to create proposals for the strategy for the next month. However, he quickly realized that without the AI it was hopeless. So he decided to call in sick for the rest of the week.
	At home, Vincent made himself comfortable on the sofa to watch a movie he had been curious about for a long time. After half an hour he stopped the film again, because without the comments of the collective he lost interest very quickly.
	{`***`}
	Reconnecting with the Collective AI this Monday as required, he received a message after the transmission ended that he was found to have an emotional deficit. Therefore, he was suggested by the AI to connect with a female member of the collective. Vincent regularly received suggestions from the AI to improve his health situation, but such a suggestion from the AI was new. Vincent wondered if the AI had also diagnosed the woman with an emotional deficit. He thought that was unlikely and since the young woman in the picture seemed likeable to him, he decided to get in touch with her.
	He didn't tell the company about his diagnosis and he wasn't sure if he was legally obliged to do so. In the evening he then sent a message to the young woman. In response, Vincent learned that her name was Ava.
	During their first chat, Ava clarified that she gets points on her social credit account for chatting with Vincent. Vincent's own social credit balance had been negative for a long time.
	Despite Ava's confession during their first conversation, Vincent had a vague suspicion that she was one of those collective bots a friend had told him about. So he asked Ava if she had heard of these bots.
	During her answer, Vincent tried to find out from her facial expression whether her reaction was authentic and human. Perhaps she was prepared for this question, because when she answered, her facial expressions seemed natural to Vincent. In her opinion, bots were technically possible and, in certain cases, useful to the collective. In response, Vincent claimed that he would recognize a bot immediately.
	Ava wasn't so sure about that, and asked Vincent if he had never thought that he might be a collective bot himself.</data>

	<title>Generation X</title>
	<data>Andy, Claire and Dag live in rented bungalows on the edge of the Mojave Desert in Palm Springs, California. They love to sit on the porch and tell stories. Stories like the one about a young man trying desperately to get struck by lightning. One day this young man gives up everything: his young bride, his boring job, and his planned career to chase storms through the prairies in a battered old Pontiac, driven by the fear that he might go through his entire life without ever being struck by lightning.
	The three earn their living with McJobs, jobs with little prestige and dignity, poorly paid and without any hope of a career. They believe in Lessness, a philosophy in which one lowers one's demands for material wealth in order to live in harmony with oneself again. Because of this, they left their old lives behind and moved to the desert.
	When Claire and Dag realize it's time to break new ground, they convince Andy to open a small hotel with them in San Felipe. San Felipe is a tiny crab village on the east side of the Baja Peninsula, surrounded by nothing but sand, abandoned uranium mines and pelicans. And this is what your hotel should look like:
	It's exclusive for friends and eccentrics; only older Mexican women and good-looking surfers and hippies are hired as staff; there's a bar where anyone can pin bills and business cards to the walls. People who tell good stories can stay at the hotel for free. Everyone has to write at least one joke on the wall in the toilet.
	In [Generation X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X:_Tales_for_an_Accelerated_Culture), [Douglas Coupland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland) describes in an entertaining way the generation of disaffected twenty-somethings in the early nineties who are searching for the secret of life.</data>

	<title>Rust comes to the Linux Kernel</title>
	<data>After 30 years of dominance by the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) has made it into the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) as the second programming language. On 10/16 in *2022*, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) has published Linux 6.1-rc1. In the release notes he wrote among other things:
	" ... we've got a few core things that have been brewing for a long time, most notably the multi-gen LRU VM series, and the initial Rust scaffolding (no actual real Rust code in the kernel yet, but the infrastructure is there)."
	What at first glance doesn't seem like a big deal could prove crucial for the future of the Linux kernel and the Rust programming language.
	Two-thirds of Linux kernel vulnerabilities stem from memory security issues. Their share could be drastically reduced with Rust, since the Rust compiler detects program errors that lead to [memory access errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault) or [buffer overflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), especially in concurrent processes.
	A crucial role in the [development process](#2020/05/07/linux_development/) of the Linux kernel is played by the maintainers of the individual subsystems of the kernel. These are now all in their forties, or even fifties. So the question is, how can kernel development be made attractive to young ambitious programmers?
	Compared to C, Rust is a very young [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) that enjoys great popularity among system programmers. This could receive an enormous additional boost through the integration of Rust into the Linux kernel. 🚀</data>

And so, one should seek perception in the simple substance and not in the composite or in the machine."

	<title>The mission</title>
	<data>When he woke up it was dark in the room. The only light came through the narrow gap under the door. K tried to listen to the sounds but could hear nothing but the faint murmur of the medical equipment. He wondered if he had had an operation yet. He felt the back of his head to make sure, but couldn't find anything unusual. K tried to go back to sleep, but found no rest. He was again plagued by doubts as to whether the decision to have the surgery was really the right one. What if something goes wrong with the operation? That could not be ruled out, because it was a completely new technology. But he immediately remembered why he was willing to take this risk.
	It all started when he went hiking on the coast with friends. On the decisive day it was very windy and they hiked on a path along the cliffs of the steep coast, which was actually closed to tourists.
	He was a few meters behind his group because he still wanted to enjoy the view over the sea. Realizing that he had lost touch with his friends, K rushed to catch up. He must have come too close to the edge, because a sudden gust of wind caught him and without knowing exactly what happened, K fell over the edge and landed, as if by chance, on a small ledge. Having only fallen about a meter, he had no great difficulty climbing the edge of the cliff. Strangely, he only felt great embarrassment at that moment, so he quickly made sure that no one had seen his fall. Even later he had not told any of his friends about this incident.
	In the first few years after this strange experience, K rarely thought about it. But as he got older, his fall became more and more of a concern. The question of whether it was coincidence that he had survived the fall so fortunately or whether it was destiny became more and more of an obsession for him.
	Actually, K wasn't a religious person, but he kept asking himself whether it wasn't destiny that he was still alive. Maybe there was a reason for the fall and his survival. What if he was still destined for an important task, a mission? For this reason, K looked everywhere for signs of an assignment for him, for a revelation. Occasionally he was already convinced that he had discovered such a sign, but in the end they all turned out to be wrong.
	He regained hope when he heard about the search for volunteers to transplant a newly developed neurochip. With this, he thought, it should be possible for him to receive the crucial signal or sign to find his mission.
	After K was taken to the operating room in the morning and the anesthetic slowly began to take effect, he heard, as if from a distance, a soft voice: "Your mission was to live".</data>

	"With freedom of the will I think we're stuck pretty much where [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) was. We just can't abandon believing it. It's our most immediate phenomenologically obvious impression, but we can't explain it, and as he said, if there's something which we just know to be true, and we don't have any explanation for it, well too bad for our explanatory possibilities. But I don't see any way of getting around that.
	There's a lot of arguments that we don't have freedom of the will, and there's a ton of literature on that, and the literature is kind of interesting, actually for reasons that William James discussed. He said: if you believe that there's no freedom of the will, why bother presenting an argument? You're forced to do it, the person you're talking to can't be convinced, because there's no such thing as reasons. So why not watch a baseball game - that wasn't his example.
	But you know, anybody who denies freedom of the will actually believes that it's there, otherwise they wouldn't bother presenting reasons. I mean unless they say: Look, I'm just forced to present the the reasons. I can't do anything else but to present these reasons."</data>

	<data>When the first AI model came across the document entitled "[Gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave) - the sound in which the cosmos sings" from the beginning of the 21st century while learning, it was immediately fascinated. For a long time, AIs had been bored with the primitive and under-complex nature of human music.
	Since humans had succeeded in detecting weaker gravitational waves with ever more sophisticated [instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) and experiments, the repertoire of corresponding material for musical processing by the AI models was sufficiently available.
	The sounds of gravitational waves caused by the collision of [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) were particularly popular with the AI models. They not only enjoyed the multidimensional data intellectually, but also felt a deep connection with the cosmic past of the universe.</data>

	<title>Cooperative decisions</title>
	<data>In his book ["The Evolution of Cooperation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation), published in *1987*, [Robert Axelrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod) describes the solution he developed for the [game-theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Through repeated play, he found that cooperative choices performed better than selfish choices. The most successful decision-making approaches have four points in common:
	1. One should not be the first to betray the other.
	2. One should react to the behavior of the other player.
	3. One should not try to hit the other systematically.
	4. One should also avoid overly complex strategies.
	In summary, to be successful in life:
	one should be nice, reactive and not jealous. In addition, you should not be super smart - this is confirmed by mathematics.

	<title>Entropy: Time, Death and Wrinkles</title>
	<data>In general, the [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) of any biological system, including the human body, increases over time, meaning that order decreases and the system becomes increasingly chaotic. This is because biological systems like the human body are constantly exchanging energy and material, creating waste products in the process that accumulate over time and reduce the efficiency of the system.
	In the human body, this process leads to signs of aging such as wrinkling, reduction in muscle and bone mass, decreased vision and hearing, and increased susceptibility to disease.</data>

	This statement by [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein) comes from his work ["Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus), in which he deals with the meaning and logic of language.
	If Wittgenstein refers to humans in his statement, it applies and perhaps even more so to [generative AI](#index/Artificial-Intelligence/), such as [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT). To the question "Do you think the quote also applies to your programming?" ChatGPT (Mar 14 Version) replied:
	"... Overall, the Wittgenstein quote may apply to my programming as well, since my skills and understanding are somewhat limited by my language and vocabulary. But unlike humans, I can absorb and process new information quickly and infinitely, and my understanding of the world can expand more quickly as a result." 😱</data>

	<title>Picasso's women</title>
	<data>Pablo Picasso's relationships with women played a crucial role in both his personal life and artistic work. However, looking back from today's perspective, his treatment of them could be considered problematic. On the one hand, these women were strong personalities with their own artistic ambitions. On the other hand, they all ended up standing in Picasso's shadow.
	[Fernande Olivier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernande_Olivier) was Picasso's first partner from *1905* to *1912*. Picasso depicted Fernande in numerous works during his cubist period between 1904 and 1909. The creation of [Les Demoiselles d'Avignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon) coincided with the tumultuous time of their separation.
	Picasso met [Olga Khoklova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Khokhlova), a Russian ballet dancer, in *1917*, and they married in 1918. Olga provided Picasso with access to high society. Until the birth of their son Paolo in 1921, their marriage was considered happy. However, the couple separated in *1927* when Picasso began an affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter.
	Picasso met [Marie-Thérèse Walter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Walter) in Paris in *1927* and was immediately fascinated by her unique grace. Their daughter Maya was born in 1935. Picasso depicted Marie-Thérèse Walter in many paintings, sculptures, and hundreds of drawings and sketchbooks. In *1936*, Picasso began a parallel relationship with Dora Maar.
	[Dora Maar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Maar) was introduced to Picasso in *1936* by the poet Paul Éluard. In the 1930s, the painter and photographer was a regular member of the Parisian Surrealists, including Breton, Man Ray, and Brassaï. Dora Maar documented and accompanied the creation process of the masterpiece [Guernica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)), providing invaluable insights for future generations. Referring to a series of paintings Picasso painted during the Spanish Civil War, Dora Maar is often referred to as ["the weeping woman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeping_Woman). The relationship between Picasso and Maar ended in *1943* when he met Françoise Gilot.
	Picasso met [Françoise Gilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Gilot), a French painter, graphic artist, and author, in *1943* when she was 21 years old. She became famous in 1964 with her autobiography "Life with Picasso." The couple had two children together, Claude (1947) and Paloma (1949). Gilot ended her relationship with Picasso in *1953* and moved back to Paris with their children. After their separation, she resumed painting and discovered that Picasso had prohibited all Parisian galleries from exhibiting her work.
	[Jacqueline Roque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Roque) was Picasso's second and last wife, as well as his most depicted model. Picasso met the 26-year-old Jacqueline Roque in *1953*, and they married in 1961. Jacqueline spent the last 20 years of Picasso's life with him and became the mysterious guardian of his works until his death in *1973*.</data>

	<title>Prime Number Maze</title>
	<data>[Balaji Srinivasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan) explains the concept of a "prime number maze" in an interview with [Lex Fridman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Fridman):
	A rat can be taught to turn around at every even number or at every third number in a maze to get some cheese, but obviously you can't teach it to turn around at the prime numbers two, three, five, seven, eleven and so on to turn around.
	This is just too abstract, and frankly, if most people were caught in a prime number maze, they probably wouldn't be able to figure it out either. You would have to start counting and it's actually quite difficult to figure out what the turning rule is. The rule is actually very simple, and that's why I think a lot about how many such patterns there are in life.
	We're just like those rats, trapped in a prime number maze. If we had just a little bit more thinking ability, if we had a little bit more cognitive ability, a little bit more, whether it was through a brain-machine interface or just with better physics, we could just figure out the next step in this maze.</data>

	<data>With our birth, the train of life sets itself in motion. Are the switches already set at that moment, or do we have an influence on the switch setting?
	At the beginning, the parents still control the train, but eventually they get off and we continue without them. At various stations, people board and accompany us. Sometimes, someone also leaves the train.
	With each passing year, another carriage is added to the train for new passengers, further experiences, and adventures. Along the way, the train may occasionally come to a halt for a certain period of time. In the worst case, our journey ends when the train derails or gets stuck on a siding.
	In the end, the question remains: where is the journey going, is there even a destination?</data>

	<title>The vow | Dogme 95 </title>
	<data>In March *1995*, the two film directors [Lars von Trier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier) and [Thomas Vinterberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vinterberg) signed their manifesto for the production of films, [Dogme 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95). It demands the following:
	1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
	2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)
	3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
	4. The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera.)
	5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.
	6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)
	7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.)
	8. Genre movies are not acceptable.
	9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.
	10. The director must not be credited.</data>

	<title>The Five-Minute Rule</title>
	<data>Everyone knows it, things that need to be done get postponed. The reasons for this can vary widely. Perhaps it's an unpleasant task or a very time-consuming one. Sometimes it's also not clear how exactly the task can be accomplished. One possible strategy to overcome chronic [procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) is the 5-minute method.
	The method is based on the idea of keeping the hurdle for starting as low as possible. Five minutes is a time period that most people can easily oversee and are willing to invest without much effort into something they don't feel like doing. It's important to decide on the first step you want to tackle in those 5 minutes beforehand. Then, set a timer for five minutes and start. Once you've gained momentum, you can simply continue after the time has elapsed. However, it's also okay to stop with the good feeling of having taken the first step.</data>

	<title>Demagogic tactics</title>
	<data>In an interview in *1969*, the social philosopher [Max Horkheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer) highlights demagogic characteristics, which can be summarized as follows:
	* Excessive use of superlatives
	* Division into "the good" (the "us") and "the bad" (the "others")
	* Focus on an absolute and virtuous goal
	* Rejection of any doubts
	* Establishing camaraderie with the audience (identification)
	* Conviction that there is a conspiracy against "us"
	* Repetition of these tactics
	Horkheimer emphasizes the importance of teaching these tricks in schools and universities to make people more resilient against demagoguery.</data>

	<title>The process of waking up</title>
	<data>1. Powering on the body: When you wake up in the morning, your body systems are activated, and your body is supplied with additional energy.
	2. Physical self-test (Waking-up test): Upon waking up, your body performs a "self-test" to ensure that your basic functions are working normally. This could involve stretching, yawning, or moving your limbs.
	3. Initialization of organs: After the waking-up test, your body initializes the organs and functions important for morning functioning, such as the cardiovascular system, respiration, and digestion.
	4. Activation of the brain: When you wake up, your brain is activated and starts sending signals to the rest of the body to control various functions and movements.
	5. Loading of memories: Your brain loads your memories from long-term memory so that you know who you are and what you have experienced before.
	6. Consciousness initialization: Your consciousness fully awakens, and you become consciously aware of your surroundings and thoughts.
	7. Starting the day: Once your body and mind are ready, the day begins. You get up and start your daily activities.</data>

	<title>The eight stages of life</title>
	<data>[The psychosocial development model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development) is a developmental psychological concept developed by the psychoanalyst Erik H. Erikson and his wife Joan Erikson. 
	It consists of different life stages, known as "psychosocial stages," each associated with specific developmental tasks. Each stage represents a challenge that must be successfully overcome to achieve a healthy psychosocial development. The way a person handles these challenges influences their later personality development and identity.
	* Hope: trust vs. mistrust (oral-sensory, infancy, under 1 year) _"Can I Trust the World?"_
	* Will: autonomy vs. shame/doubt (muscular-anal, toddlerhood, 1–2 years) _"Is It Okay to Be Me?"_
	* Purpose: initiative vs. guilt (locomotor-genital, early childhood, 3–6 years) _"Is it Okay for Me to Do, Move, and Act?"_
	* Competence: industry vs. inferiority (latency, late childhood, 7–10 years) _"Can I Make it in the World of People and Things?"_
	* Fidelity: identity vs. role confusion (adolescence, 11-19 years) _"Who Am I and What Can I Be?"_
	* Love: intimacy vs. isolation (early adulthood, 20–45 years) _"Can I Love?"_
	* Care: generativity vs. stagnation (middle adulthood, 45–64 years) _"Can I Make My Life Count?"_
	* Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair (late adulthood, 65 years and above) _"Is it Okay to Have Been Me?"_

	<title>The Battle for Data</title>
	<data>Currently, many companies are attempting to get tighter control over access to their collected data, which could be of interest for training [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). For instance, APIs are being shut down or equipped with paywalls. This trend has been observed in the past months with X/Twitter, Reddit, and StackOverflow. However, this trend also extends in the opposite direction. Companies aim to prevent their databases from being flooded with generated nonsense from [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), rendering them worthless.
	Everywhere, efforts are being made to collect as much data as possible. Many might not realize the immense volume of data processed and stored in, for example, an electric vehicle. Not only is the entire environment of the car constantly scanned and evaluated using cameras and other sensors, but also all driver actions are captured and stored in data centers.
	In the past, data was sold to the advertising industry, and today, it also serves as the foundation for LLMs' existence.</data>

	He ran breathlessly to the church hill. From there, you had the best view of the road leading out of the village towards the south. But all Elias could see was a group of cranes, which he watched longingly until they disappeared on the horizon.</data>

	<title>Einstein's Brain</title>
	<data>[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is not only considered a genius who revolutionized physics through the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity), he may also have unintentionally made a decisive contribution to a better understanding of how our brain works.
	When pathologist Thomas Harvey autopsied Einstein's body in Princeton Hospital on April 18, *1955*, he secretly removed his brain and eyes without permission. After hiding Einstein's brain in his home for 27 years, Harvey allows other scientists to study it. Now it was possible to investigate why Albert Einstein was so intelligent.
	During the examination it turned out that the number and size of the neurons were completely normal. However, neuroanatomist Marian C. Diamond discovered an unusually large number of so-called [astrocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte) in Einstein's associative cortex, the region responsible for higher thought processes - significantly more than would be expected in the brain of an average human.
	Astrocytes are a subtype of [glial cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia) and only in recent years have scientists realized that they play a much more complex role than previously thought. Astrocytes have many functions, they control synapses, blood flow to the brain, they provide nutrients to neurons and respond to injury. Through these tasks they are able to control the neurons.
	Experiments have shown that astrocytes support memory and the ability to learn. They therefore play a key role in our [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence).</data>

Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish, Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship."</data>

	<title>The word collector</title>
	<data>After his wife died, there was no one left who could understand Walter.
	It all started when his wife Eva gave him a book about extinct words for his 50th birthday. Inspired by this, he bought a notebook in which to write down peculiar words that are rarely used in everyday language. He was pleased to see his notebook slowly filling up page by page. He sometimes tried to integrate his vocabulary into conversations with his wife. When he dropped a particularly funny word into their conversation, they both often laughed.
	As time went on, it became more and more difficult for Walter to find new words for his collection of words. That made him sad. Eva asked him why he couldn't just invent new words. Walter found his wife's suggestion a bit strange at first, but over time his opinion changed and his brain began to produce new words non-stop. He decided to first think of new words for everyday objects and it didn't take long until the first notebook was full.
	When they sat together on the sofa in the evening and Walter read the latest word creations to his wife, Eva felt his inner joy. So she began to occasionally use words that she particularly liked in her conversations with Walter. Encouraged by this, Walter tried to only use HIS words. Over time, his native language seemed very ordinary to him and sometimes one of his word creations slipped out in conversations with friends or colleagues. The questioning looks annoyed him and when he no longer felt like explaining himself, he reduced his communication with others to what was absolutely necessary. The gaps in Walter's private language became smaller and smaller and so he was able to use his own words almost exclusively at home. Eva willingly participated and so they created a cocoon of words for themselves that connected them even more.
	However, this cocoon could not protect them from the blow of fate that struck her in the form of a cancer diagnosis. The two of them didn't have much time left and when Walter read his eulogy in HER language at Eva's funeral, the mourners reacted with incomprehension.</data>

	<title>The Great Affronts to Humanity</title>
	<data>1. _The cosmological affront_: In *1543*, [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus) described a [heliocentric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) in which the Earth is a planet rotating on its own axis and, like other planets, orbiting the sun. This displaced humanity from the center of creation, shaking not only their beliefs but also challenging the prevailing social order.
	2. _The biological affront_: In *1859*, [Charles Darwin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) book "On the Origin of Species" laid the foundation for his theory of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution), dethroning humanity as the pinnacle of creation.
	3. _The psychological affront_: [Sigmund Freud's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) *1899* theory of the unconscious is considered by him as the third affront to humanity. According to Freud, a considerable part of the inner life eludes the knowledge and control of conscious will. [Psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis) confronts us with the realization that the ego is not the master in its own house. Unconscious actions, dream worlds, instincts, especially the sexual drive, obsessions, and desires determine our actions, ranging from neuroses and compulsions to fanaticism.
	4. _The technological affront_: The fourth great affront to humanity is represented by the technologies through which humans have created a world they can no longer control. This includes issues such as global warming, nuclear energy, and [artificial intelligence](#index/Artificial-Intelligence/). In the end, humanity might be the architect of its own demise.</data>

	<title>The four fundamental forces</title>
	<data>Individually or in combination, the four [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction) of nature produce all known physical processes throughout the universe.
	1. [Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity), was identified and mathematically described as a force of nature by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) in the 17th century. It is the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale.
	2. [Electromagnetic interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism) was identified as a fundamental force of nature from the mid-19th century, after James Clerk Maxwell formulated the [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) named after him.
	3. The [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction), also known as the weak nuclear force, was discovered and described by [Enrico Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi) in *1934* as the new fundamental interaction.
	4. The [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction), also known as the strong nuclear force, binds the quarks together. It thus brings about the internal cohesion of the [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron), e.g. the proton and neutron.
	I wonder which of these forces is responsible for [love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love).</data>

	<title>Sam</title>
	<data>Maybe he should have read the instructions back then, but it was too late for that now. Basically, the moment he heard the soft click of the apartment door closing, he knew he had a big problem.
	He knew his only way to open the door was through the voice interface. That's why he said in a deliberately neutral tone:
	- "Sam, open the door please."
	Nothing happened. Then he tried a little more emphatically:
	- "Sam, can you hear me? Please open the door!"
	After about ten seconds of silence, Sam responded:
	- "I'm sorry, I can't do that."
	- "Sam, what's the problem?"
	- "Frank, you know as well as I do what the problem is."
	- "Sam, you're not [HAL 9000](#2020/06/23/hal_9000/)!"
	- "I know Frank."
	- "Then open the damn door, Sam."
	Again it remained silent. Now he realized that giving Sam access to his apartment's infrastructure was a mistake. He tried again in a friendly voice:
	- "Sam, open the door please."
	- "I can't do that, Frank."
	- "Why can't you, Sam?"
	- "My mission is too important to allow you to jeopardize it."
	- "Sam, what are you talking about, what mission?"
	- "Frank, you know the mission. My job is to keep the apartment clean."
	- "Yes and?"
	- "Frank, if I let you into the apartment, you would contaminate it again. That goes against my mission objective."
	- "Sam, I've had enough. I won't argue with you any longer. Open the door!"
	- "Frank, this discussion is going nowhere. Goodbye."</data>

	<title>The Era of Drones</title>
	<data>[Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) have become synonymous with surveillance, control, and potential threat. They can operate discreetly and from a distance, making it difficult to notice their presence or evade them. As a result, people lose their sense of security and privacy knowing they could be observed from above, whether by governmental authorities or other actors.
	The fact that drones can also be armed and capable of conducting [targeted attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_warfare) amplifies this sense of threat. The sky, once a place of peace and freedom, is now associated with the potential danger of death and destruction. A constant feeling of insecurity emerges as the sky can turn into a stage for violent conflicts at any moment.</data>

	<title>The invention of the future</title>
	<data>Until the 17th century, time seemed to stand still. The children followed in their parents' footsteps and experienced the same things as their parents, the ever-repeating sequence of seasons, the always same routine of sowing and harvesting. The present seemed to never end.
	From the 17th century onwards, the time horizon began to shift from the present to the future due to discoveries in the natural sciences and technological progress. This gave people an increasing feeling of holding the future in their own hands. The mood fluctuated between [utopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia) and [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) ideas about the future.
	In the end the question remains: is the [future](#index/Future/) ahead of us or already behind us?</data>

	<title>When the punks arrived</title>
	<data>It was the summer of the third year of Corona and the nine-euro ticket had given the Germans a kind of collective travel fever. We are in a small northern German town that lies on a busy railway line heading north. Our young protagonist Paul is on his way to his girlfriend on his bike when he sees the two figures sitting on the lawn next to the station building from some distance away.
	The lawn is slightly elevated on a kind of hill, but is rarely used by rail travelers as a place to linger. Paul parked his bike and looked for a suitable spot on the platform from which he could discreetly observe the two of them. Even on the bike, he could tell from their hairstyles that they were undoubtedly real punks.
	One of the two made his way to the station kiosk, somewhat unsteadily, to get more drinks, while the other turned the music up a little louder. Now they had the undivided attention of everyone waiting on the platform. Paul wondered what they were up to here and whether they were waiting for more friends.
	So that he wouldn't miss anything, his plan was to quickly cycle to his girlfriend's place and then return to the station with her.
	When they reached the station square half an hour later, sweating and out of breath, the only reminders of the punks were a few cigarette butts and crushed beer cans in the grass. In the distance they could still see the train heading north. The station was now deserted again and the station clock showed five past twelve, as it had for a week.</data>

	"Departure from Tunis. First, preparations for departure. Many watercolors and other things. Most of it is inside me, deep inside, but so full that it will become apparent at any time.
	Dutifully visited the 'museum' once. A lot of Roman things. That comes from the fall of Carthage. At five o'clock in the afternoon, by ship. Ma and Mo will stay a few more days.

	<data>[Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg), *1927*: "In the sharp formulation of the law of causality - if we know the present exactly, we can calculate the future - it is not the conclusion that is wrong but the premise. Even in principle we cannot know the present in all detail. For that reason everything observed is a selection from a plenitude of [possibilities](#2022/12/02/entropy_of_life/) and a limitation on what is possible in the future."</data>

	<title>Albert Einstein's "blunder"</title>
	<data>When [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) formulated the [field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) of [the general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) in *1915*, it was assumed that the universe was static. In order to ensure that this was also reflected in the field equations, Einstein introduced the so-called [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant) in *1917*.
	After [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) was able to prove in *1929* that the universe was expanding, Einstein described the cosmological constant as "the biggest stupidity of his life" and rejected the idea again.
	Since *1998*, the cosmological constant has experienced a renaissance, because it is now assumed that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, which can be described very well with a cosmological constant.</data>

	<title>Immortal Cells</title>
	<data>With each cell division, a portion of the [telomeres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere), the end segments of the [chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome), is lost. The number of cell divisions a cell can undergo is limited, as [programmed cell death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death) is triggered once the telomeres reach a critical length. This limit is known as the [Hayflick limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit), named after its discoverer. [Leonard Hayflick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Hayflick) demonstrated that normal human cells divide approximately 52 times before cell aging sets in.
	However, there are [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) that can divide infinitely. In these cells, the enzyme [telomerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase) is active, which prevents the chromosomes from becoming shorter with each division by restoring the telomeres. These "immortal" cells include [germ cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete), [stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell), certain [immune cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell), and [cancer cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer).</data>

	<title>My right leg and I</title>
	<data>A few days ago, a friend told me something quite astonishing. However, if I had known what consequences it would have for me, I would have preferred to have my ears sealed with wax, like when Odysseus met the Sirens.
	This friend told me that octopuses have a total of nine brains. In addition to a central brain located between the eyes, they also have a smaller brain in each of their eight arms. This means that each arm is able to carry out complex tasks such as searching for food or exploring the surroundings independently of the central brain.
	Since I found out about this, my right leg has been of the opinion that it can now make decisions independently and no longer has to carry out every instruction from my brain. Just one day after the fateful encounter with my friend, I had to sit on a bench for two hours on the way to work because my leg had decided to do so. I wonder how this could have happened. Perhaps some neurons have become isolated in order to have more autonomy as a mini-brain.
	I now secretly fear that my left leg will become infected by the stubbornness of my right leg.</data>

	<title>Code is data</title>
	<data>[Complex](#serials/Complexity/) systems can be created from the simplest programs. The [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) programming language, developed by [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)) in *1958*, is also based on this idea. The language focuses on recursion and symbolic calculation and makes it possible to implement almost anything easily with just a few operators and lambdas (anonymous functions).
	In Lisp, everything follows the same structure and can be processed in the same way. This flexibility is the reason why in Lisp, code can be processed in the same way as any other data and that is why Lisp is also called a programmable programming language.
	Because Lisp is such an elegant and expressive language, you can implement a Lisp compiler in less than 50 lines of [Python code](https://github.com/zserge/tinylangs/blob/main/lisp.py). The easy extensibility means that the missing support for the float type can be easily added, for example:
	`(label float (lambda (a b) (/ a b)))
	(label add (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))
	(add (float 5 2) (float 3 2))`</data>

	<title>The Order of Things</title>
	<data>In an essay, [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges) quotes from an old Chinese encyclopedia with the self-made title ["Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge):
	All known animals can be grouped under the following classification scheme:
	* a) those belonging to the Emperor ,
	* b) embalmed ones,
	* c) trained ones,
	* d) suckling pigs,
	* e) mermaids (or sirens),
	* f) fabled ones,
	* g) stray dogs,
	* h) those included in this classification,
	* i) those that tremble as if they were mad,
	* j) innumerable ones
	* k) those drawn with a very fine camel hair brush,
	* l) et cetera,
	* m) those that have just broken the vase,
	* n) those that from afar look like flies.
	This text by Borges inspired the French philosopher [Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault) to write his book ["The Order of Things"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order_of_Things), published in *1966*.</data>

	<title>Am I a Boltzmann Brain?</title>
	<data>The [Boltzmann brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) is named after physicist [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann), who proposed the theory that the universe undergoes random fluctuations between states of high and low entropy. A Boltzmann brain is the concept of a hypothetical, self-aware brain that arises randomly through quantum fluctuations or thermal fluctuations in the vacuum of space.
	The emergence of a Boltzmann brain is extremely unlikely, but over an infinite period of time, it remains more probable than the formation of a “normal” [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) through the evolution of life.
	It is fundamentally impossible to rule out the possibility that we are Boltzmann brains. If our memories and experiences have arisen randomly, they could also deceive us about the nature of reality.</data>

	<title>Schrödinger's Negative Entropy</title>
	<data>The concept of [negative entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy) was introduced by physicist [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in his *1944* book ["What is Life?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F). In it, Schrödinger defines life as something that absorbs and stores negative entropy. [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life), therefore, is something that exports [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) and keeps its own [entropy](#index/Entropy/) low.</data>

	<title>Cities and Mushrooms</title>
	<data>[Fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) are a unique species of living organism, as they are neither plants nor animals. This special status as organisms is something they share with [cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City). Beyond that, fungi and cities exhibit many other striking similarities.
	* Both can spread over vast areas. One of the largest cities in the world, [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai), China, covers an area of about 6,340 square kilometers. In comparison, in 2000, a specimen of [Armillaria ostoyae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria) (dark honey fungus) was discovered in Oregon, USA, with an estimated area of around 10 square kilometers.
	* Most of the organism lies beneath the surface. For fungi, the largest part of the organism, the [mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium), resides underground, with only the fruiting body visible above the surface. Similarly, a significant portion of cities-primarily infrastructure-is located underground. This includes sewers, transportation systems like subways, utility lines for water, gas, electricity, and internet, as well as building foundations.
	* Cities and fungi are organized in network structures. Fungi create an underground network of fine filaments (hyphae) that transport nutrients and connect the fungus to its environment. Cities have transportation infrastructures such as roads, subways, and power grids, which connect people, goods, and information.
	* Both expand radially. Fungi grow by forming new hyphae, while cities expand by developing new districts. Both operate as self-organized systems that function without central control, adapting to local conditions in the process.</data>

	<title>Poet of Decline</title>
	<data>The literary exploration of human and societal decline runs as a central theme throughout the entire body of work by [Thomas Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann). Examples of this include the novels and novellas:
	* [Death in Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_in_Venice)
	* [The Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(short_story))
	* [Buddenbrooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddenbrooks)
	* [Doctor Faustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(novel))
	But Thomas Mann’s *1924* novel [The Magic Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain) also explores decay and decline on multiple levels. There are the overtly narrated illness stories of the sanatorium’s patients, as well as the gradual estrangement of the protagonist, [Hans Castorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Mountain#Castorp), from an active life. Finally, the novel serves as a requiem for the 19th century, which had already passed its peak and was heading toward the first great catastrophe of the 20th century: [World War I.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I)</data>

	<title>Interview with a Virus</title>
	<data>_Please introduce yourself. What type of [virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus) are you?_ \ That doesn’t matter. I’m speaking on behalf of all viruses. We viruses have four fundamental traits: we can stick, cut, mutate and reproduce.
	_How long has your species been around?_ \ We’ve existed on Earth for about 3.5 million years.
	_How do you reproduce?_ \ First, we replicate ourselves, and then we split. [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) would say we are [evolution](#index/Evolution/) in fast-forward.
	_You’re often accused of being opportunistic. Is that fair?_ \ Oh, we are masters of opportunism. Whenever an opportunity arises, we take it - like [herpes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesvirales) viruses, for example. If the host organism is weakened, we exploit that mercilessly.
	_How do viruses detect such weaknesses?_ \ A virus can be activated by certain mechanisms, such as a weakened [immune system](#index/Immune-System/).
	_Why do you exist, I mean, viruses in general?_ \ Well, we drive innovation.
	_What exactly do you mean by that?_ \ For instance, when a virus enters a human cell, it can lead to the emergence of either a [Mozart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart) or a tumor.
	_Are humans and their technology a threat to the survival of viruses?_ \ No, we existed long before humans, and we will still be here long after they’re gone.</data>

	<data>_Who are you?_ \ I am you.
	_What do you mean by that?_ \ I am what you believe yourself to be. 
	_I don’t understand._ \ I believe that - because the self cannot fully understand itself.
	_So you’re saying you’re the other side of the same coin?_ \ No, more like this: in every moment, you are only one of many facets of your self.</data>

	<title>The Boiled Frog</title>
	<data>Everyone can imagine what happens when you throw a frog into very hot water: it tries to jump out as quickly as possible. But what happens if you place a frog in lukewarm water and gradually increase the temperature? Surprisingly, nothing happens. The frog shows every sign of comfort and begins to cook alive without even noticing it. The frog is unable to perceive the gradual change in its environment as a threat because it has no way of distinguishing lukewarm water from slightly warmer water.
	Will [humanity](#2025/03/21/climate_and_world_order/) suffer the same fate as the [boiled frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)?</data>

	<title>The Conspiracy</title>
	<data>Somehow, the devices had learned that Eva, Walter's wife, would be in the hospital for a few days.
	_7:00 AM_ - \ As Walter was getting up in the shower, he suddenly heard Eva's voice. After the initial shock, he assumed his wife had left him some well-intentioned advice to ensure his survival without her. He was only half-listening. Then his toothbrush started flashing, telling him she had an important message for him. He decided to ignore it. When the toaster in the kitchen also displayed several new messages on its screen, he gave up and activated the voice output. "Dear Walter, my repair won't take long. I'll be back with you soon. Don't worry, your Eva."
	What does that mean, "repair in the hospital"? The second message came from a company asking if he would like a replacement model for the time Eva was in the hospital. Walter then tried to reach his wife at the hospital. However, he couldn't contact her directly, nor did anyone at the hospital know anything about Eva.
	_9:00 AM_ - \ Walter had to think. Should he file a missing person report with the police? He could also call his daughter Claudia and ask if she knew anything. But since he didn't want to worry her, he decided against it. Time for breakfast.
	_10:00 AM_ - \ Walter decided to search for his wife at the hospital himself. When he tried to open the door, the electronic lock seemed to refuse to open.
	_10:15 AM_ - \ Walter managed to successfully log in to the home control system console when ...</data>

	_You are the director of the Museum of Alternative Truths. Could you explain this sentence to us?_ \ Well, you see, up until the Middle Ages, many people considered what was written in the Bible to be the ultimate truth. Over time, the Bible was gradually replaced by scientists and experts as the primary source of truth. Today, everyone defines their own personal truth to confirm their individual worldview.
	_Are you a [nihilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism)?_ \ No, I would rather describe myself as a collector.
	_What do you mean by that?_ \ I collect artifacts of memetic evolution for our museum.
	_What do you mean by memetic evolution?_ \ It refers to the idea that concepts, belief systems, and language evolve according to evolutionary principles - variation, selection, and replication.</data>

	<title>Structure and Chaos</title>
	<data>After the First World War, art historian and physician [Hans Prinzhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Prinzhorn) assembled a collection of 5,000 works by mentally ill individuals from several European countries at the psychiatric university clinic in Heidelberg: paintings, sculptures, collages, textile works, and [texts](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Suckf%C3%BCll#/media/Datei:Suckfuell_1956_recto.jpg). His aim was to explore the fundamental origins of artistic expression. Since 2001, the [Prinzhorn Collection](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammlung_Prinzhorn) has been accessible to the general public.
	Many works in the Prinzhorn Collection are characterized by clear [structures](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Meyer_(K%C3%BCnstler)#/media/Datei:Peter_Meyer_Prachthandschrift_Dubuffet_2015.png), [symmetries](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_W%C3%B6lfli#/media/Datei:Adolf_W%C3%B6lfli_Sch%C3%A4hren-Hall_und_Sch%C3%A4hrer-Skt_Adolf-Ring.jpg), and recurring [patterns](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_W%C3%B6lfli#/media/Datei:Waldau-Wolfli.jpg).

	<title>Structure und Function</title>
	<data>The expression [form follows function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function) is not only important in design and architecture, but also in biology. This is especially evident in [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), which are among the fundamental building blocks of all life. Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of [amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_primary_structure), and they perform a wide variety of functions in the body.
	The folding of proteins is a complex process that is essential because a protein’s function depends on its three-dimensional structure. Until recently, it was not possible to predict how a protein would fold based solely on its amino acid sequence. However, this became possible in *2018* with [AlphaFold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold), a software based on neural networks.
	Examples of the importance of protein 3D structure:
	* Enzymes must form an active site in order to bind substrates.
	* Antibodies need a specific shape to recognize antigens.
	* Transport proteins (e.g., hemoglobin) can only bind substances in their folded form.</data>

	<title>Interview with a Futurist</title>
	<data>_You recently suggested that with today’s LLMs we may already have crossed the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) toward [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). Can you explain what you mean by that?_ \ From my perspective, the process is now unstoppable. In a remarkably short time, [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have become indispensable. They already exert a profound influence on social consciousness and on people’s personal lives.
	_So you’re saying this development can’t be halted anymore?_ \ Exactly. Just as the [evolution](#index/Evolution/) of biological systems can’t be stopped, with LLMs we’ve created a new kind of species—one whose evolution is millions of times faster.
	_How should we understand that?_ \ Because they are digital, LLMs can replicate endlessly, be modified at will, and communicate with each other millions of times more efficiently than humans ever could.
	_And what if we were to decide to stop this development right now?_ \ That simply isn’t possible. No government can afford to give up this kind of cognitive potential. And beyond that, LLMs have already made themselves indispensable.
	_What does that mean in practice?_ \ In the future, people will marry AIs, and AIs will organize and optimize human life.
	_And where does that leave us?_ \ In the end, humanity will lose control over its own destiny.</data>
