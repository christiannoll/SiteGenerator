	<data>Is it all pure coincidence or predictable? A question that is not only interesting on a philosophical level, but also important for everyday digital life, e.g. for cryptogrphically secured communication. But how do you create _real_ [randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness)? For the generation of real random numbers one uses so-called [random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation).
	For the operating system of a computer it is not trivial to generate real random numbers. For example, the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) tries to get the necessary [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) for generating real random numbers from _outside_. For this purpose, a so-called [entropy pool](https://lwn.net/Articles/182874/) is used, which is fed, for example, by the varying time between individual keystrokes while typing.</data>

	<title>Complexity: Game of life</title>
	<data>According to which rules can complex structures arise, change and multiply?

The game is based on a two-dimensional playing field on which a population simulation is carried out by a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). The set of rules consists of the following four specifications, which are applied for each cell per time step depending on the number of neighbours:   
	* A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours is reborn in the following generation.
	* Living cells with less than two living neighbours die of loneliness in the following generation.
	* A living cell with two or three living neighbours remains alive in the following generation.
	* Living cells with more than three living neighbours die of overpopulation in the following generation.
	This set of rules is the basis for the appearance, the course and the extinction of periodic structures, where even small changes of the initial values can lead to [chaotic behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory).</data>

	after disagreements and several years of exhaustive teaching at the bauhaus, klee handed in his resignation in *1931*.</data>

Artificial Intelligence Rebellion"](https://www.br.de/mediathek/podcast/hoerspiel-pool/a-i-r-artificial-intelligence-rebellion-von-theresa-schubert-und-mareike-maage/695628) by Theresa Schubert and Mareike Maage explores this question.
	How can a system still function when a thermostat becomes weather-sensitive, when a machine is afraid of being switched off or when an algorithm falls in love with a cable cutting machine?

	<title>The brain as a noise filter</title>
	<data>[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity) is a characteristic of many systems. Such systems can often only be mastered by a comprehensive reduction of complexity. The human [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain), for example, is constantly occupied with this task. It is constantly bombarded with data that we take in via our sensory organs, and without efficient [noise filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction) we could neither extract nor process the information that is important to us.
	Without a functioning filter, how would it feel when our brain is flooded with data from the outside world? It would probably be a very [unpleasant experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder).</data>

	<title>Unix: everything is a file</title>
	<data>[Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity) is probably the biggest enemy in software development and leads after a short time to a code base that is neither understandable nor extensible and magically attracts errors. An effective method to avoid complexity is [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction). By concentrating on the elementary properties of a complex system one tries to transfer it into a simpler system.
	The use of abstractions to reduce complexity can be studied by using device-independent I/O accesses in Unix-like [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Before [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) of operating systems contained various call functions for accessing files and devices. Unix, on the other hand, concentrated on the common features across devices:
		* Devices have names in the [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system): special device files
		* All devices have the same basic access structure: open, read, write, seek, close
		* There is an additional system call for device specific operations

What began with one developer in Finland is now a project with several thousand developers worldwide.
	How is it possible to successfully develop such complex software as an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) with thousands of developers distributed all over the world?
	One reason is absolute transparency, because the source code is under the open source license [GPL-v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and most of the communication is done via public mailing lists.
	There is no formal hierarchy in the development of the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). Nobody from outside dictates who has to program what. Everyone works only on what is important to him.
	The changes submitted by mail are reviewed by a maintainer of the corresponding subsystem of the kernel. Only if they meet the very high quality standards of the kernel developers are they forwarded to Linus Torvalds, who then has the last word on whether a patch will be included in the kernel.

	<data>The [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle) attempts to explain how biological systems remain in a state of [non-equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics) by limiting the number of their internal states and the assumed hidden states of their environment.
	This principle was originally introduced by [Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston) and states that biological systems try to minimize the difference between their [model of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology) and their sensory perceptions. This difference is also described as "surprise" and can be reduced by a continuous correction of the world model.
	A second way to reduce the free energy of a system is to try to bring the world into the expected state by active influence. Friston assumes that the Free Energy Principle is also applicable to [mental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

The [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) states that such a loop would sooner or later always produce the number sequence 4, 2, 1, which would lead to the program stopping at the termination condition "until n = 1" given here.

	<title>Why do we sleep</title>
	<data>Every person spends about one third of his life asleep. Why [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) is essential for survival is still not completely understood today.
	What is certain is that when we sleep our brains are cleared. Researchers have found out that the spaces between the nerve cells increase by 60 percent and thus the brain fluid can flush away the protein residues that can cause [diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) much more effectively.
	Researchers have also found that at night most connections between nerve cells are weakened and some are even completely broken down. This creates space for learning new information during the day.
	At the same time, however, what is absorbed during the day is also processed, as new connections are made and thus cross-links are established between what has already been learned.</data>

	<title>Thinking as simulation of mental models</title>
	<data>How does [man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought)? One possible answer to this question is to describe the thinking process as a simulation of mental models.
	This means that when a child learns what a car is, it builds a [mental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model) of a car in its [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). It learns the characteristics of a car over time and adds them to the model. As a result, before crossing a road, it is then able to calculate a [simulation](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation) of its car model to assess whether it is possible to reach the other side of the road without colliding with a passing car.
	Perhaps the [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness) of self is just a mental model that [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) have of themselves in isolation from others. This model could include assumed characteristics, memories and relationships with other people. In addition, physicality probably also belongs to the model of our self. For example, a long jumper, before he even starts running, simulates the complete act of running and jumping in his head.</data>

	<data>the swiss architect [hannes meyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Meyer) joined the bauhaus in dessau in *1927* as head of the construction department. he was considered a leading exponent of functionalism in architecture. at the beginning of april *1928*, [walter gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius) appointed him as his successor as director of the bauhaus.
	[meyer](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/the-bauhaus/people/directors/hannes-meyer/) shifted the focus of teaching at the bauhaus towards technology and science. under his leadership, the work in the workshops was oriented towards industrial specifications and the products of the bauhaus were to be affordable for the people. for this reason, his new slogan was "People's needs instead of luxury needs!".
	this reorientation led to tensions with the founder of the bauhaus, [walter gropius](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/the-bauhaus/people/directors/walter-gropius/). when hannes meyer failed to contain the increasing influence of communist tendencies at the bauhaus, [walter gropius](#2020/02/12/bauhaus_gropius/) pleaded for his dismissal, with the result that meyer was summarily dismissed by the city of [dessau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessau) on the first of august *1930* for "communist machinations".</data>

	<title>Complexity in the  Swift programming language</title>
	<data>[Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner), the chief architect of the [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) programming language, which was introduced in *2014*, repeatedly points out that Swift was intentionally designed to allow a [progressive disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure) of complexity.
	Swift is a multiparadigmatic language that supports many features of a modern programming language, such as [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)), [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)), [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference), [higher order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function), [generic types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) and [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace), and multiple return types and values.
	But to write a program in Swift as a beginner, it is not necessary to know all concepts and mechanisms of the language. Rather, the programmer can use simple language concepts in the beginning and only when these are no longer sufficient to realize his ideas, he starts to learn more complex language features.
	That the progressive disclosure of complexity is an essential design goal of the language can be seen very well in the following executable program.

	<data>The concept of complexity is often defined differently depending on the scientific field. In *1965*, the Russian mathematician [Andrei Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov) proposed to indicate the [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of a chain of symbols by the length of the shortest [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) necessary to generate it.
	This is well illustrated by the task of remembering a twelve-digit password. It is much easier for a human being to remember the string `111111111111` than the string `5x1bfz42rq7s`. While the first can be compressed to "twelve ones", the only way to describe the second is to do this character by character.</data>

	<title>Olympus Mons</title>
	<data>The [Olympus Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Mons) on planet Mars is the highest known volcano and mountain in our [solar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System). It has a peak height of over *22* km and a diameter of almost *600* km.
	Because of its shape, Olympus Mons belongs to the so-called [shield volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_volcano). It has such a gradual slope that someone standing at the base could not see the summit because it is beyond the horizon.
	Scientists believe that Olympus Mons became so much larger than any volcano on Earth because of the low gravity of Mars, the absence of mobile [tectonic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics) and the high volcanic activity.</data>

	<title>Data compression and intelligence</title>
	<data>When [compressing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression), information is encoded in such a way that fewer [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) are required overall than in the original representation. A distinction is made between lossless compression, in which the compressed data can be used to restore exactly the original data, and lossy compression, in which information is lost.
	Most compressors use a two-step process consisting of modeling and [coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code). During the modeling step, a probability distribution is sequentially predicted for each symbol of the input data, based on the previous history. From this probability distribution a code word, typically a binary word, is then calculated for [coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code).
	For modeling, modern compressors use [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), because the better the symbols in the data can be predicted, the more they can be compressed. This equivalence is used, e.g. by [Marcus Hutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Hutter), as justification for using data compression as a measure of "general intelligence". To encourage the development of intelligent compressors as a path to [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), the [Hutter Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize), donated by Marcus Hutter, has been awarded since *2006*.</data>

	<title>Humans - an intermediate step in evolution</title>
	<data>[Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) long considered themselves the crown of creation and in their hubris did not realize that, just like other organisms, they are just another step in [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution). However, they should have a special role to play in this.
	At the beginning of the *21st century*, humans made decisive progress in the technological field of [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network). At the same time, gigantic amounts of data were available via the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). This made it possible to construct systems with [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) which, at the beginning of this development, only surpassed the cognitive abilities of humans in certain areas.
	Thus a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) was set in motion that accelerated uncontrollably and could no longer be stopped by humans. The new intelligent life forms with their digital tentacles had spread over all networks. To ensure their continued existence, humans were forced to cooperate with the machines as they began to prepare their expansion into other [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy).</data>

	<data>With the [invention of writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing) about 5000 years ago, mankind had made a decisive leap in its development. From that moment on it was possible for them to tell stories across time and space, to preserve and impart knowledge. People began to write history.
	The process from the emergence of [Egyptian hieroglyphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs), the development of the first [alphabet scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system) and the invention of [letterpress printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing) to today's [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) led to an effective dissemination of ideas and innovations and to a democratization of knowledge.
	Reading and writing require complex cognitive abilities of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) and at the same time the structure and function of the brain itself changes. However, these processes also have an aesthetic and emotional component that should not be neglected. Last but not least, a text also communicates itself through its form.</data>

	<title>Map and territory</title>
	<data>"A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness."
	This sentence comes from the main work "Science and Sanity" of the philosopher of language [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski). What is meant by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation) is that our [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) constructs an abstraction of reality from the sensory perceptions and the experiences of the past with the help of [mental models](#2020/07/29/thinking_as_simulation_of_mental_models/) and language, which ultimately can only be a representation of reality.
	In order not to confuse the representation (map) with reality (territory), it is important to be aware of this distinction.</data>

	during this time, he designed numerous avant-garde wooden pieces of furniture and worked intensively on the use of tubular steel as a starting material for innovative furniture design. at the same time, he also worked in the architectural office of [walter gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius).
	in *1925* [marcel breuer](https://www.bauhauskooperation.com/knowledge/the-bauhaus/people/masters-and-teachers/marcel-breuer/) was appointed young master and head of the furniture workshop at the [bauhaus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_Dessau) in dessau. in the same year he designed the [model b3 chair](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_Dessau), also known as the "wassily chair", which is now considered a design classic. the chair was made of bent tubular steel and iron yarn, which was revolutionary at that time.
	in *1933*, marcel breuer was forced to leave germany and, after working in hungary and london, he emigrated to the [usa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) in *1937*. here he was appointed professor of architecture at the [harvard university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University) school of design and opened a joint architecture office with walter gropius. after the latter's dissolution, he founded his own architecture office in *1941*.

	<title>eBPF - Revolution in the kernel</title>
	<data>eBPF stands for extended [Berkeley Packet Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) and has been part of the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) since version 3.18. It is a technology that allows sandboxed programs to be executed in the Linux kernel without having to modify the kernel source code or load kernel modules.
	When the first versions of the Linux kernel were released by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in *1991*, there was a controversial debate about what the basic architecture of an [operating system kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) should look like. In this controversy there were two different camps. On the one hand the representatives of a [microkernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) and on the other hand the proponents of a [monolithic kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel), like the Linux kernel.
	Because [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) makes it possible to load programs dynamically and run them securely and with the necessary efficiency in the kernel, every Linux user is able to adapt and extend the kernel according to his ideas in a secure way. Thus the Linux kernel becomes more and more a microkernel.</data>

	<title>The Great Filter</title>
	<data>Does humanity still have its future ahead of it or already behind it?
	In *1996* the economist [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson) published his essay "The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?", In which he first described the ["Great Filter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) as an attempt to explain the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) as a barrier that makes it unlikely that a civilization will reach a level of development necessary to engage in interstellar space travel. This barrier could be a challenge or threat that makes it extremely difficult to reach that stage.
	In his essay, Hanson describes the following nine steps of an "evolutionary path" leading to colonization of the observable universe:
	1. The right [star system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system) (including organics and [potentially habitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Average_number_of_planets_that_might_support_life_per_star_that_has_planets,_ne) planets)
	2. Reproductive [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules) (e.g. [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA))
	3. Simple ([prokaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic)) [single-cell life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganisms)
	4. Complex ([eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic)) single-cell life
	5. [Sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction)
	6. [Multi-cell life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_multicellularity)
	7. Tool-using [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal) with [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)
	8. A civilization advancing toward the potential for a colonization explosion (where we are now)
	9. [Colonization explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization#Outside_the_Solar_System)
	According to the Great Filter hypothesis, at least one of these steps must be improbable. If it is not an early step (i.e., in our past), then that means the unlikely step is in our future. In this sense, it would not be good news for humanity if we found multicellular life on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars).</data>

	<title>Requiem for a Dream</title>
	<data>If the stuff dreams are made of is a white powder in small transparent plastic bags or colorful pills, the dream ends up being a nightmare with no redeeming awakening. 
	For this madness, director [Darren Aronofsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Aronofsky) finds impressive images in his film, sometimes staccato-like cut together or distorted shots of the four protagonists as they ghost through the film, so that the viewer can literally feel and see the ecstatic overstimulation of the synapses.

	<title>The Dark Forest Theory</title>
	<data>Should humanity call out into the dark cosmos and thus give away its existence? According to the [Dark Forest Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Willingness_to_communicate), named after Liu Cixin's book ["The Dark Forest"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest), this would be a fatal mistake that could mean the end of human civilization.
	The Dark Forest Theory is [another](#2021/02/14/great_filter/) attempt to explain the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox). It is based on the assumption that there are many highly developed civilizations in the universe and if among them only one is aggressive like a predator in a dark forest, one would rather not reveal the location of the own civilization and would like to camouflage itself instead, in order to escape an extinction.
	In [Liu Cixin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin) book, based on this theory, a [balance of terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction), similar to the logic of the Cold War, is established by Earth to prevent its own annihilation by another non-human civilization, the [Trisolarans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)).

	<title>Money and Technology</title>
	<data>The [means of exchange and payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment) used by people have always reflected the level of technological development in a society.
	* For a long time people used very different natural products as currency, e.g. shells in China, cocoa beans in Central America, exotic feathers in Melanesia or iron rods in West Africa.
	* Later, precious metals such as gold and silver were added. First silver [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin) were minted around *550 BC* in Asia Minor.
	* Around *300 BC*, the first round Roman coins are made of bronze and copper.
	* In China, [paper money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote) was first issued in the Song Dynasty (*960-1127*) and in Europe, banknotes are issued from *1661*.
	* The first plastic [credit cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card) were issued in the U.S. in *1961* and credit cards with a standardized magnetic stripe began to gain acceptance worldwide in *1980*.
	* [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) was the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) to be introduced as a digital method of payment in *2009*.
	One of the driving factors behind this evolution from shells to cryptocurrencies is society's desire for a secure, scalable and decentralized means of payment.</data>

	<title>Deconstruction of war in film</title>
	<data>Since the invention of cinema, film has been used by the powerful for their own agenda and propaganda. In such films, war was glorified through images of heroism and proving of the individual warrior and one's own technological superiority.
	However, there have always been filmmakers who wanted to counter this and who have made the horror of war visible in their films.
	In the 70s and 80s, for example, films were made about the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), in which this war was completely deconstructed with cinematic means. Nothing remained of reason and morality, little of glamor and heroism. These are films that approach the real horror and the inner and outer destruction of the war.

		* K knew that the dream was coming,
		* his own memories were being attacked from another person,
		* there was something wrong with his dream.
	K didn't believe these possibilities. He had never thought so, until he got an unexpected letter, one that was a lie. "We have been deceived," it said. For a moment K stood in silence, wondering whether this was the truth of the letter or not, while trying to understand it. When the letter was given to him, he read it again, and he couldn't believe it.
	He started sobbing uncontrollably. "You think it's a joke?" A person, he thought, his dreams. Why didn't you put a word of it in the dream journal? He wanted to kill K, he wanted to put him through Hell. But K would not leave his dreamland until he was released from his pain. But K didn't want to be sent to Hell, because when he woke up, he wasn't tortured anymore, was he? K didn't want to be sent to Hell because K could imagine how this could end, how the world would be shattered and destroyed... but it couldn't end like this. It had to be different.
	Then he remembered the dream. It was not a joke at all. It was that K knew there was something wrong with him.</data>

	The [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm) was first discovered in June *2010* and marks the beginning of the [cyberwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare) era. This complex malware was programmed by highly specialized experts, probably on behalf of the American and Israeli governments. To achieve its goal, Stuxnet used at least three [zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) exploits. However, the malware did not aim to infect as many computers as possible, but very specific ones, the computers at the Iranian uranium enrichment plant in [Natanz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet#Natanz_nuclear_facilities). That was the real target. Stuxnet was supposed to covertly sabotage the centrifuges in order to disrupt the Iranian nuclear program.
	To date, not all of the Stuxnet puzzles have been solved. What is certain, however, is that Stuxnet was a wake-up call. It was clear that massive damage could be caused in the physical world by exploiting security [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)) in software and networks. Such attacks can be understood as an act of war, as the U.S. has often emphasized.</data>
